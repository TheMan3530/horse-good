Okay so here's how to get each secret song:

Trolled: After you beat the main week, check freeplay.
Anadila: If you pick a song in freeplay, there is a chance that, instead of loading the actual song, Anadila will be loaded.
Oh Yeah Sue Me: After you beat the main week AND Trolled, check the Charting menu, then click the button in the top-left corner, press the left button after, then type "oyasumi" into the bar.
Aubergine: Like Oh Yeah Sue Me, but type "aubergine" instead.
Monochrome: On freeplay, pause and unpause your song. There's a chance you'll enter Monochrome.
