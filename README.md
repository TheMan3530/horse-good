(This mod is meant for the Pico Day mod jam.)

A horse is a horse, of course, of course, and no one can talk to a horse, of course, that is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr. Ed!

(it should be noted that this mod is nothing like the original Mr. Ed, and is merely based off a joke between me and my friend, and thus, do not play this thinking it's a normal mod about Mr. Ed.)

SYNOPSIS

So remember when Ninjamuffin said that Pico had schizophrenia? Basically, he forgets his medication, causing him to see the events of the mod. Yep, that's it.

Also, check the files of the mod. There are quite a few easter eggs hidden in here, including (currently) 3 bonus songs with Pico as the main character.

Tip: Once you beat the main week AND the bonus song in freeplay, check the charting menu, more specifically, the corners of the screen. You may see something new.

Check HOW_TO_BUILD.md to se how to compile.
